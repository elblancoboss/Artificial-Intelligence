# Artificial-Intelligence
For this assignment, I created a project in Unity and using C# to demonstrate artificial intelligence for a non-player character.  The non-player character will be able to chase and attack the camera (player I am controlling), this can be done by implementing a script in C#. This will enable the character to have a path finding awareness to find and follow the camera and attack it when it gets near it.

This obviously cannot be done without having animations for the character as well so it would look realistic when the character is walking or attacking.

I picked this idea because I find it interesting to implement artificial intelligence on a non-player character. I have never done this before so it is exciting for me to do. This is the first time I am using Unity and C# programming language, but surely this assignment helped me learn new skills in Unity and C#.
